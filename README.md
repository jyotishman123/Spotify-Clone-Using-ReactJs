 # This app is built for development purposes and has many limitations due to being built under the Spotify developer tool. Additionally, the app is designed according to my Spotify account.

The app is built using React.js and Spotify Web API.js, and only premium account users can play songs. Non-premium users can only view songs and playlists.

### Disclaimer:

* In the home section, the playlist is shown according to my Spotify playlist. After downloading the code, make sure to change the Spotify playlist ID in the request.jsx file. All the playlist details and IDs are stored in an array of objects.
* To play a song on this website, you must first select a song from your Spotify account, whether it's the app or the website, and make sure the account is the same as the one you logged into on my Spotify clone website. After that, you can search and select a song from my app and play it.
* When you play a song from this website, the song actually plays in your original Spotify app or account. Due to some limitations, when playing a song, the previous song's details are shown in the player.
* The Skip Previous and Next buttons only work while you are playing the actual playlist on the original account; otherwise, the buttons will not work.
